//    * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.

//    * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.

//    * If user picks the same as computer then they tie.

// 4. We then add to their score.

//    * If user wins then we add one to their wins.
    
//    * If user loses then we add one to their losses.
    
//    * If user ties then we add one to their ties.

// 5. The user then presses r, p, or s to play again.
